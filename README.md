# Dynamic Programming Problems

This repository contains daily Dynamic Programming (DP) problems solved in Java.

## Day 1: Fibonacci Problems

1. **Day1_FibonacciSeriesWithoutArray.java**
   - Iterative Fibonacci series without using an array.
   - Space efficient (O(1) space).

2. **Day1_FibonacciSeriesArray.java**
   - Iterative Fibonacci series using an array (bottom-up DP).
   - Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(n).

3. **Day1_FibonacciMemoization.java**
   - Recursive Fibonacci calculation using memoization (top-down DP).
   - Avoids repeated calculations using a HashMap.
   - Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(n).


## Day 2: Climbing Stairs Problems

1. **Day2_ClimbingStairsRec.java**
   - Recursive solution for climbing stairs.
   - Very inefficient due to repeated calculations (exponential time).
   - Time Complexity: O(2^n), Space Complexity: O(n) (recursion stack).

2. **Day2_ClimbingStairsDP.java**
   - Dynamic Programming solution using an array (bottom-up approach).
   - Stores results of subproblems in a dp[] array.
   - Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(n).

3. **Day2_ClimbingStairsOptimized.java**
   - Optimized DP solution without using an array.
   - Uses only two variables (`prev1` and `prev2`) to track results.
   - Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(1).

## Day 3: House Robber Problem

1. **Day3_HouseRobber.java**
   - Classic DP problem: given money in each house, find the maximum money that can be robbed without robbing two adjacent houses.
   - Uses an iterative bottom-up approach with **space optimization**.
   - Transitions:
     - `cur = max(prev1, prev2 + num[i])`
     - `prev2 = prev1`, `prev1 = cur`
   - Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(1).
   - Example:
     ```
     Input:  [2, 7, 9, 3, 1]
     Output: 12
     Explanation: Rob house 1 (2) + house 3 (9) + house 5 (1) = 12
     ```

## Day 4: Maximum Sum of Non-Adjacent Elements

1. **Day4_MaxSumNonAdjacent.java**
   - Problem: Given an array, find the maximum sum of elements such that no two chosen elements are adjacent.
   - This is the **generalized version of the House Robber problem**.
   - Approach:
     - Use DP with two states:
       - `include = arr[i] + exclude`
       - `exclude = max(oldInclude, exclude)`
     - Update iteratively.
   - Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(1).
   - Example:
     ```
     Input:  [3, 2, 5, 10, 7]
     Output: 15
     Explanation: Pick 3 + 5 + 7 â†’ maximum = 15

     ```

### How to run
- Open the project in any Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.) or use terminal.
- Compile and run the respective `.java` files.
- Input the number for Fibonacci when prompted.
